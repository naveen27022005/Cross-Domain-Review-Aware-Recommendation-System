# Cross-Domain Review-Aware Recommendation System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **Cross-Domain Review-Aware Recommendation System** that leverages user reviews from multiple domains (e.g., books, movies) to improve recommendation quality. By learning shared representations across domains, the system addresses data sparsity and enhances personalization.

The project focuses on data preprocessing, review aggregation, feature extraction, and model experimentation for building an effective recommender system.
